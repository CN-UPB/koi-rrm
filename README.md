# KoI Radio Resource Management

Authors: SÃ©bastien Auroux, Donald Parruca

This repository contains all code for the Radio Resource Management approach developed within the Koordinierte Industriekommunikation (KoI) project (http://www.koi-projekt.de).

In particular, this work has been published in:

* S. Auroux, D. Parruca, H. Karl: Joint real-time scheduling and interference coordination for wireless factory automation. In Proceedings of the 27th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), Valencia, Spain, September 2016.

## Content

The repository consists of the following folder structure:

* local_allocation: the local real-time scheduling approach
* global_coordination: the superordinate global interference coordination approach

All implementations are based on Python 2.7 and require additional packages and/or software as described in the individual README.md files in the respective folders.
